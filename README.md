# 🔧 EDHamPy

**EDHamPy** (*Eat Ham Pie* or in French *manger de la quiche*) is a Python-based, highly parallelized **Exact Diagonalization (ED)** package tailored for solving various many-body quantum physics problems. It currently supports simulation of **Fractional Quantum Anomalous Hall (FQAH)** systems on models with crystal lattice translation symmetry and **Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH)** systems on **torus geometry**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- 🔬 **Core purpose**: Perform efficient exact diagonalization of strongly correlated systems using highly parallel sparse matrix methods.
- 🚀 **Performance**: In many cases, EDHamPy matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-art ED packages like [DiagHam](https://www.nick-ux.org/diagham).
- ⚙️ **Scope**: Currently focused on computing many-body energy spectra. Future support for additional observables is planned. An object-oriented re-programming is also envisioned.

📊 Benchmark
------------

### Example: FQHE  for electrons at  $\nu=1/3$  of  the  zeroth Landau level

![image](./benchmark/Compare_spectra_FQHE_filling1-3_torus.jpg)

Perfect agreement with well-known many-body spectra of FQHE at $\nu=1/3$ on torus. The left panel is copied from [Haldane’s work](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.55.2095) and the right panel shows the results computed using EDHamPy taking advantage of many-body translation symmetry, as explained in the paper mentioned before.

### Performance 

EDHamPy has been benchmarked against well-established ED packages such as [DiagHam](https://www.nick-ux.org/diagham) on FQAHE simulations. It shows perfect agreement and, in some scenarios, superior performance.
